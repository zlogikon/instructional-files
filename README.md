# Sample instructional materials
<a href="https://zlogikon.github.io/instructional-files/">Project homepage</a>

These materials were created for computer classes I have taught in public libraries.

To improve accessibility, I have reformatted the content into responsive webpages.

Originally these materials would have included slide decks and printed supplimentary information.
