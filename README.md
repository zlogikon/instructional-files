# Sample instructional materials
Follow this link to view the <a href="https://zlogikon.github.io/instructional-files/">project homepage</a>.

These materials were created for computer classes I have taught in public libraries.

To improve accessibility, I have reformatted the content into responsive webpages. Pages are responsive for large and small screens. In addition, using print commands in the browser will remove menus & unneeded space while also inserting print urls for external links.

Originally these materials would have included slide decks and printed supplimentary information.
