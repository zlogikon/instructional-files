# Responsive web design
<a href="https://zlogikon.github.io/project1-blog/">Project homepage</a>

This project was created as part of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program.

This is a sample website I created using responsive design, Grid, and Flexbox. The website consists of an original homepage and one additional blog post. Both pages use responsive design with multiple break points for small, medium, and large screens.
