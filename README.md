# Instructional materials Sample
<a href="https://zlogikon.github.io/instructional-files/">Project homepage</a>

These materials were created for computer classes I have taught in public libraries.

I have reformatted them into responsive webpages in order to make them more accessible.

Originally these materials would have included slide decks and printed supplimentary information.
