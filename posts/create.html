        <h2>Creating Secure Passwords</h2>
      </div>
        
      <div id="main-content">
        <p>Over the years, passwords have evolved from simple 4 digit PINs (personal identification numbers) to longer alpha-numeric strings. In recent years, many websites have begun requiring a minimum of 8 digits, with some combination upper and lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers. This evolution has made creating and remembering multiple passwords ever more challenging!</p>
        <p>But hese changes in password conventions are not without merit. Given technological advancement, data thieves have created ever more devious ways to crack passwords and steal money and the more from unsuspecting victims. As the first line of defense for online accounts, password security should be on the mind of every person that uses the Internet.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, we will examine what goes into creating secure passwords.</p>
        <p>Simply put, long passwords are more secure. Ideally, your passwords will be 16 or more letters, numbers, and symbols. That sounds like a lot to remember, but try reimaging passwords as passphrases where each random letter is replaced by a word. For eample:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Password: aatmbtm - 7 letters</li>
          <li>Passphrase: AllAroundTheMulberryBushTheMonkey - 33 letters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above passphrase is far more secure than the randomized string because of it's length, though it is not significantly harder to remember. Other alternative phrases you might choose could include song lyrics, poems, or any other meaningful phrase you may find memorable. What are some memorable phrases that could act as a basis for a secure password?</p>  
        <p>Many people think it is a good idea to have only one password for many accounts. After all, it is easier to remember. But this is not a good idea. If one account is hacked, all of your accounts will be compromised. Use a different password or passphrase for every account. This will help minimize the damage that can be done in case one of your accounts is hacked or compromised.</p>
        <p>Your email account is one of your most important accounts and deserves a strong password and good security. Why is this? Many online accounts use email addresses as an identifier and a means to reset passwords. If you get locked out of your email, you may not be able to reset your other passwords. Likewise, if you email account is hacked, data thieves may be able to reset your other passwords and access those accounts as well.</p>
        <p>For many people, remembering passwords can be difficult, especially for accounts that are used infrequently. In some cases, it might be easier to just reset your password everytime you use it. For example, if you only use a password once a year, consider just resetting it whenever you use it. Just be sure you are able to reset it when needed by keeping your email or security questions up to date. We will examine other ways to manage frequently used passwords in the next lesson.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a different password or passphrase for every account.</li>
          <li>Long passwords are more secure. Consider using a “passphrase” or combination of words to increase the length of your password.</li>
          <li>Keep a record of your most important passwords.</li>
          <li>If you write your passwords down, be sure to keep them in a safe place as you would a checkbook or other important documents.</li>
          <li>If you use a password manager, be sure to create a way to recover this account in case you forget your password. This may include two factor authentication or writing down the information.</li>
          <li>When creating passwords or passphrases, be sure to include letters (lower and uppercase), numbers and symbols.</li>
          <li>Don’t bunch letters, numbers and symbols all together. Spread them out. Better yet, replace some letters with numbers or symbols.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A not-so-good password: MyPassword123!!</li>
            <li>A much better password: MyPa$$Phra$3I$P3rf3ct!!</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
