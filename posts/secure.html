        <p>Two Factor Authentication (aka 2FA or Multi Factor Authentication) is a security process in which you are required to enter a second passcode when signing in to an online account. Often this second code is delivered to you via email or text message (SMS). This second layer of security helps ensure you are the person logging in to your account. 
        <p>Each 2FA system works in different ways, but the general procedure is the same:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You will log in to your account as you normally would using username/email and password.</li>
            <li>You will then be asked to enter another passcode. This passcode will be generated at that time so there is no way to guess it and old passcodes will not work.</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Depending on the system, this passcode will be sent to you via email, text (SMS), push alert on your smartphone, or it will be displayed in one of the specialized 2FA apps. When you set up 2FA for an account, you will be prompted to select which method is best for you.</p>
        <p>Each method has its own benefits and drawbacks. Most methods require you to have access to your phone, but some systems allow you to receive passcodes via email. This can be convenient if you do not have a phone or reliable service.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>There are several 2FA smartphone apps available that can help you consolidate 2FA access codes from many websites. A list is provided below. When linked to an account that supports 2FA, these apps generate a 6 to 8 digit code for you to enter into the website. It will generate a new code approximately every 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Though 2FA apps like Google Authenticator require a smart device, they do not require phone service. For example, if you are in a building with poor reception or traveling abroad, you can still get a passcode, even if you can't receive text messages or phone calls. These apps can also be used on tablets, though this may be more inconvenient if you do not have your tablet handy when you need to log in to a service.</p>
        <p>2FA is a great tool to help secure important accounts like email, bank, social media, and online shopping accounts.</p>
        <p>While 2FA can add another level of security for your most important accounts, it might not be necessary for every account. If you have an account that does not include a lot of personal or financial information, it may not require 2FA security.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2FA can help secure your account in the event your password is stolen or your accounts are accessed without your knowledge.</li>
          <li>Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, LastPass, and Microsoft all have 2FA functions, but you will need to turn them on for it to work. Check the settings in your account to set them up.</li>
          <li>If you decide to use a 2FA app, be sure to understand how to recover your account in case your phone is lost or stolen.</li>
          <li>With most services, you can choose to have the website or service remember a computer you frequently use. This will ensure you do not need to enter 2FA passcodes every time you log in.</li>
        </ul>
