        <p>Once you have begun the process of creating more secure passwords and passphrases, it is a good time to develop a system for organizing your log in credentials.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to organize your passwords is to write them down in a notebook or journal. Keep this notebook in a safe place. Treat it like you would any other important documents. In many ways, your password list is no different than your check book, resume, auto insurance policy, or social security card. After all, most of this data is online in the accounts currently protected by your password list!</p>
        <p>In other words, don't write your passwords on a sticky note you keep by your monitor or undr your keyboard. These practices are all too common and are not secure.</p>
        <p>One drawback to writing down your passwords is you may not have access when needed. Another solution is to use a password manager app. These apps encrypt password information in your smart phone or web browser. They can sync your data accross devices and even alert you when you have duplicate or unsecure passwords. Some password managers even allow family members to share access to passwords.</p>
