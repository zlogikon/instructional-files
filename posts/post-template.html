        <h2>Creating Secure Passwords</h2>
      </div>
        
      <div id="main-content">
        <p>Passwords have long been used on the Internet to secure information like email accounts, social media profiles, and even bank accounts. Creating and maintaining secure passwords is the first line in protecting personal information on the Internt. And yet, many people struggle with this, whether they find passwords to difficult to remember or they continually get locked out of their own accounts.</p>
        <p>Good News! You don't have to keep repeating the same cycle of creating passwords and forgetting them, only to repeat the cycle again. With some effort up front, we can create secure passwords and organize them so that we can have confidence in the security of our online information and in our ability to access that information when needed.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, we will examine waht goes into creating secure passwords.</p>
        <p>Long passwords are more secure. Ideally your passwords will be 16 or more letters, numbers, and symbols. That sounds like a lot to remember, but try reimaging your passwords as passphrases where each random letter is replaced by a word. For eample:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Password: aatmbtm</li>
          <li>Passphrase: AllAroundTheMulberryBushTheMonkey</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The above passphrase is far more secure because of it's length (33 characters!), though it is not significantly harder to remember than the seemingly random string of letters.</p>  
        <p>Your email account is one of your most important accounts and deserves a strong password and good security. Why is this? Many online accounts use email addresses as an identifier and a means to reset passwords. If you get locked out of your email, you may not be able to reset your other passwords. Likewise, if you email account is hacked, data thieves may be able to reset your other passwords and access those accounts as well.</p>
        <p>Many people think it is a good idea to have only one password for many accounts. After all, it is easier to remember. But this is not a good idea. If one account is hacked, all of your accounts will be compromised. Use a different password or passphrase for every account. This will help minimize the damage that can be done in case one of your accounts is hacked or compromised.</p>
        <p>One simple and effective way to keep track of your passwords is to write them down. If you do, be sure to keep them in a safe place and treat them as though they were your check book, tax returns, or birth certificate.</p>
        <p>Another way to secure your passwords is to use an online password manager. These services encrypt all of your passwords and make them available through apps or browser add-ons. These services can be very helpful but be careful not to locked out of your account! Follow the instructions for setting up a methd for recovery as soon as you create a new account.</p>
        <p>For many people, remembering passwords can be difficult, especially for accounts that are used infrequently. In some cases, it might be easier to just reset your password everytime you use it. For example, if you only use a password once a year, consider just resetting it whenever you use it. Just be sure you are able to reset it when needed by keeping your email or security questions up to date.</p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a different password or passphrase for every account.</li>
          <li>Long passwords are more secure. Consider using a “passphrase” or combination of words to increase the length of your password.</li>
          <li>Keep a record of your most important passwords.</li>
          <li>If you write your passwords down, be sure to keep them in a safe place as you would a checkbook or other important documents.</li>
          <li>If you use a password manager, be sure to create a way to recover this account in case you forget your password. This may include two factor authentication or writing down the information.</li>
          <li>When creating passwords or passphrases, be sure to include letters (lower and uppercase), numbers and symbols.</li>
          <li>Don’t bunch letters, numbers and symbols all together. Spread them out.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A not-so-good password: MyPassword123!!</li>
            <li>A much better password: !my2PassPhrase3Is4Purrfect!</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
